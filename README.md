# Project Codebound

## Description

Simple RPG game project in `C#` made as part of study material. Concrete list of features will vary with the study session. 

Starting ideas are as follows:

- UI and enemy placement inspired by ***Earthbound*** (***Mother*** series of games) ~~as the name suggests~~

- Dynamic backgrounds and enemy animations

- *Boss-rush* type gameplay (game consisting mostly of enemy waves with little rest in-between)

## Launch

Project can be accessed via command line with `dotnet run --project CodeboundCore`

***IMPORTANT NOTE***: Project *needs* to have its 180 X 50 buffer size to be rendered. The resize code is *still unfinished*, so for now make sure it is, indeed, 180 X 50. You can change it by lowering the font size in the terminal settings.
